# Timer

## Designed the following circuit

## How it works
The user uses the 2 buttons to specify the interval. The device detects how long the button was clicked for and adjusts the adjusting speed accordingly. I used the LCD screen to show the time left to the user. Once it's done counting, it plays a sound for 3 seconds using the piezo to notify the user. The user can reset the timer mid-way using the reset button on the arduino.
